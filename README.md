Creating a class type through specification

For this problem you will create three files: 
dayType.h: Contains the class definition for the class dayType
dayTypeImp.cpp: Contains the function definitions for class dayType
testDay.cpp: Contains your main program that tests your newly 
             created class.

Follow the specifications outlined in Problem 5 on Page 731 of your textbook. The implementation of your class is very similar to the 
class types discussed and created in Chapter 10 of your textbook.

Make sure you have a header comment with you name, course, due date and assignment number. Also provide commenting throughout your code so logic of your coding is understood by others, especially your instructor.

Also, you need to draw a UML diagram of your class using your Engineering Computation Pad paper. You will submit the UML diagram on the class day immediately following the due date of the assignment. The UML diagram needs to be hand-drawn. Do not use a computer program or printer to complete the UML diagram.

Upload your dayType.h, dayTypeImp.cpp, and testDay.cpp files to Canvas. Do not zip them together. Upload the files individually then click submit.

Deadline of program is Sunday, January 28, 2018. Deadline for UML Diagram is Tuesday, January 30, 2018 at the beginning of class.
